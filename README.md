It looks like this in WebStorm:

VSCode version [is here](https://github.com/joeytwiddle/rc_files/tree/master/.vscode/extensions/joeytwiddle.gentle-mary-0.0.1).

I do have a port for Vim too, but it's not online right now.

----

Written specification:

- Keywords are red
- Properties are blue
- Functions / methods are green
- Strings are a (muted) yellow
- Special things like types and classes are purple
- The rest (e.g. variable names and punctuation) are muted white (light grey)
- Global variables / constants / static members may be bright white
- Some values like numbers and booleans are cyan
- Semicolons and comments are deemphasised (dark grey)

- Search results are highlighted with a blue background
- Occurrences of the word/entity under the cursor are highlighted with a green background (but not in VSCode because we cannot change the foreground colour)
